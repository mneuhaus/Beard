## Commands

### Patch

You can create an beard.json in your main directory of your project
where you can specify various patches and gerrit changes that you
need to pull in for your project. This makes it easier to distribute
development instances to other developers, that depend on pending
gerrit changes or other patches.

**beard.json**
```
{
    "defaults": {
        "gerrit_api_endpoint": "https://review.typo3.org/",
        "gerrit_git": "git.typo3.org"
    },
    "changes": [
        {
            "name": "Simple gerrit changeSet",
            "type": "gerrit",
            "path": "Packages/Framework/TYPO3.Flow",
            "change_id": "16392",

            // you can override the defaults here for each change
            // "gerrit_api_endpoint": "https://review.typo3.org/",
            // "gerrit_git": "git.typo3.org"
        },
        {
            "name": "Using a specific revision",
            "type": "gerrit",
            "path": "Packages/Framework/TYPO3.Flow",

            "change_id": "16392,1",
            // you can append the revision number with a comma after the changeId to use
            // the specific revision instead of the latest on (changeId,revisioNumber)
        },
        {
            "name": "Pull in a complete Gerrit Topic into all existing package directories",
            "type": "gerrit",
            "topic": "acl",
            "branch": "master",
            "paths": {
                "Packages/TYPO3.Neos": "Packages/Application/TYPO3.Neos"
                // You can specify the exact path for the gerrit project name
                // if a path is missing here and the project is in the form of
                // Packages/[PackageName] it will loop through the directories
                // in Packages looking for a matching folder
                // (Packages/[Application|Framework|Site|...]/[PackageName])
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Some changes out of a diff file",
            "type": "diff",
            "path": "Packages/Framework/TYPO3.Flow",
            "file": "Patches/TYPO3.Flow3.diff"
        }
    ]
}
```

**command**
```
beard patch
```

### Reset repositories

This command resets all repositories beneath the main directory to it's remote state.
This will remove any non-pushed changes from the local repositories, so be careful ;)

```
beard reset
```

### Status

The status command helps you to get an overview over all repositories beneath this directory.

```
beard status
```

## Updating

```
beard update
```

## Locking

This command helps "locking" a package to a currently installed commit:
The following example will look into the ```composer.lock``` file to find the currently installed
commit hash and set that into the ```composer.json``` to "lock" this package to that commit.

```
beard lock typo3/flow
```

## Similarity to Famelo.Gerrit

If you know Famelo.Gerrit, the TYPO3.Flow package you might think this is already covered by that,
which is true. Actually this tool is an evolution of Famelo.Gerrit, which i choose to make standalone.
Main pro's to make it standalone are:
- it works even with completely broken TYPO3.Flow project/installations
- you can use it for almost any kind of project

And just one more thing. "beard patch" will look and process your old "gerrit.json" for now as well :)
